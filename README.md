## :man_technologist: About Me:
### I am a passionate Software Developer actively acquiring new skills and learning new software languages.
### Software Development allows me to create projects that can solve real problems and provide services for companies, clients and other developers. I use my knowledge to create solutions through code and to build note-sets for revision purposes and to assist new developers.
### 
### I am also passionate about Mathematics. I have tutoring experience and have developed Mathematics Courses, but have a deep passion for Mathematics itself. Working with numbers - their power, processes and logic - embeds in Software Engineering and I have great interest of the field of Data Science in addition to continuing to learn and grow as a Software Developer.
